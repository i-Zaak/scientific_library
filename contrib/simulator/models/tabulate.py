Tabulation of numerical functions.

class TabulateInterp(object):
    '''
    An object to tabulate a numerical function with linear interpolation.
    
    Sample use::
    
      g=TabulateInterp(f,0.,1.,1000)
      y=g(.5)
      v=g([.1,.3])
      v=g(array([.1,.3]))
      
    Arguments of g must lie in [xmin,xmax).
    An IndexError is raised is arguments are above xmax, but
    not always when they are below xmin (it can give weird results).
